			Hey ya'll! I’m Chelsea Felter, I am from Mckinney,Texas. I currently moved to sunny Southern California. I am working on getting my Business degree from Texas Women University. Go Pioneers! In my spare time I “refresh” furniture. I find worn out, outdated wooden furniture and use decorative paint, wood working skills and finishing techniques to transform them into beautiful masterpieces. I was successful selling from my home in Texas and wish to continue the same here in my new home. I would like to give thanks to the wonderful Dumster Diva of Mckinney,Texas, for getting me started.  I’m currently accepting projects, so if you need me to work on your furniture, please get in touch. We are constantly striving to update and make the website easier to use. I would love to get your feedback as I'm just starting out on my new adventure.  Feel free to message me on my facebook page or send a feedback using the Contact Me page.
