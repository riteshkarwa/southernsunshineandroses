			Hey, I’m Chelsea Felter, from Texas, USA, currently living in Southern California. I am working on getting my business degree from Texas Women University. In my spare time I “refresh” furniture – I find unwanted, outdated furniture and – using paint and refinishing techniques – aim to transform it into beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces. I’m currently accepting projects, so if you need me to work on your furniture, please get in touch. My email address is chelseafelter@yahoo.com. We are constantly striving to make the website simple and easy. I would love to get your feedback. Feel free to message me on my facebook page.
