			Hey, I’m Chelsea Felter, from Texas, USA, currently living in Southern California. I am working on getting my business degree from Texas Women University. In my spare time I “refresh” furniture – I find worn out, outdated wooden furniture and – using decorative paint, tool skills and finishing techniques – aim to transform it into beautiful, master pieces. I was preety sucessful in running my shop from home backyard in Texas and wish to continue the same here in my new home of Southern California. I’m currently accepting projects, so if you need me to work on your furniture, please get in touch. My email address is chelseafelter@yahoo.com. We are constantly striving to make the website beautiful and easy to use. I would love to get your feedback. Feel free to message me on my facebook page.
